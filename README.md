A simple CRUD application for storing a list of boardgames.

Server requires MongoDB.

Done as lessons in
**Server:-**
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Passport.js (username & password currently hardcoded)
* Monk
* InversifyJS

**Client:-**
* React (with standalone components when it comes to styling)
* Redux
* Webpack
* SASS
* Extracting CSS
* Mocha
* NYC (Istanbul)
* Enzyme
* Chai
A lot of the trick was getting tests to play nicely with TS-Node and Webpack tools like the scss-loader, along with bundling components, but extracting the resulting CSS.
